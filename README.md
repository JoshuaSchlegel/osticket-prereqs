<h1>osTicket - Prerequisites and Installation Using Microsoft Azure Virtual Machies</h1>
This tutorial outlines the prerequisites and installation of the open-source help desk ticketing system osTicket using Windows 11 and Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines. Feel free to try it for yourself at no cost since <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account">Microsoft Azure</a> can be used with a free subscription for 30 days and/or $200 worth of credits. Lets do it!<br />

<h2>üíª Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Internet Information Services (IIS)
- MySQL
- osTicket

<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 11 Pro
- Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites</h2>

- Resource group with a virtual machine.
- osTicket requirements such as PHP Manager, IIS Manager, MySQL, HeidiSQL etc..
- Installation of osTicket.

<h2>üß∞ Installation Steps</h2>

<p>
*Assuming you have a Microsoft Azure account already setup, the first thing we need to do is create a resource group in Microsfot Azure and create a virtual machine within that resource group. We will use Windows 10, 2 vCPUs with 8GB of RAM. I'll call it osTicketVM with a simple Username: osticket and Password: Password1234.
</p>
<br />

- Once logged into Microsoft Azure, type "resource group" in the search bar located at the top of the screen and click on "Resource groups" to be taken to a screen where you can create a new resource group. I'll call the resource group "osTicketVM" as well, but you can name it anything you would like.

- Click on Create.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34282295-4737-47e7-87b7-6830debb0a38)

- I'll call this VM "osTicketVM". 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c88441ea-c88a-446b-8443-b1e546ebcde2)

- Once you click on "Review and Create" on the bottom left side of the screen, it will take you to the next screen for review where you will click "Create".
- You will then see a notification letting you know the Resource has been created successfully.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac5549f2-d70f-4ac6-b96a-e3dc8255eb20)

- From here, you can type "vm" into the search box up top and click on "Virtual machines".
- On the next screen you will click the "create" drop down in either the top left under "Virtual Machines" or the blue "create" drop down towards bottom middle -> "Azure Virtual Machine".

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/238085eb-8019-4765-a9d6-f9a56f1a48ca)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69e536b9-01c3-44dc-9ff2-28e7f98c0747)

- Next, click on the "Resource group" drop down and select the resource group you created. I'll also name the VM "osTicketVM" and keep it in the same region as the resource group. 

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af3f14d4-d365-4dde-a1d8-41b6648eeb61)

- Don't worry about anything else other than the *Image and *Size.
- For the "Image" drop down, we will select "Windows 10 Pro, version 22H2 - x64 Gen2 (free services eligible)". ***(If you do not see this option immediately available, scroll all the way down within the drop down for "Image" and click on "See all images". The next screen will show you all available operating systems available and you can search or find "Windows 10", click the drop down and select "Windows 10 Pro, version 22H2 - x64 Gen2 (free services eligible)".***
- For "Size", select Standard_D2s_v3 - 2 vcpus, 8 GiB memory".

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6eb32307-4ebd-463e-9c8f-3b30fb03cec8)

- I'll use the username: osticket and password: Password1234 for this VM. Make sure you check the "Licensing" box.
- For this lab, we do not need to worry about the "Disks", "Networking" or any of the "Next" options for creating a VM so we can just click on "Review + create", and then "Create" on the following screen.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aafbb3ba-3825-4333-a5fb-1d910e954b3b)

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c5ba525-a619-474f-92bc-8781946bc7c3)

- It will take a bit for the VM to be created so you can relax for a moment until the notification shows you that the VM has been deployed.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90ef2ecb-ea83-40cf-9fe5-8d614ce3cedf)

<p>
*Once the VM (virtual machine) is created, we will log into it remotely using Remote Desktop Connection which can be pulled up from the start menu or searching it in the taskbar. You will need to copy and paste the public IP address into the text box and log in using the credentials you set for the VM when it was created. Once logged into the VM, we will begin installing the required software/programs for osTicket.
</p>
<br />

- After deployment of the VM shows to be done, click on "Home" in the top left of the screen.
- Here you will see shortcuts under "Azure services" and you can just click on Virtual machines to be taken to the VM you just made.
- You will see the public IP Address on the far right side of the listed VM and you can go ahead and highlight and copy it to the clipboard.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/517172de-1637-44ff-aefe-b8d3ac959f2f)

- Next, type "Remote Desktop Connection" (RDC) in the search box located in the taskbar of your computer.
- Open RDC and paste the publick IP address of the osTicketVM in the text box and click on "Connect".
- Then log in with your admin credentials. For me it will be "osticket" for username and "Password1234" for the password. ***(You may need to click on "more choices" -> "use a different account" towards the bottom if it has a username prepopulated in the text box to sign in with.)***
- Wait for the VM to load.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06fe365e-aaba-49b1-bd89-c7873013b876)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9806a474-074e-44e8-881e-c3ca55b27c06)

*When confronted with all the options for Windows 10 after logging into the VM and/or pulling up the Microsoft Edge web browser, you can decline/say no to everything. If you already clicked through with any of the options selected it is not a big deal.

- Copy and paste the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account">osTicket-Installation-Files.zip</a> link inside our osTicketVM in a web browser to download the required files for osTicket.
- Click "download anyway".

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42e6b105-d41e-4faa-bed3-5e7a5c2c6737)

- It may help to move the osTicket-Installation-Files.zip to the Desktop by opening file explorer -> downloads and then clicking and dragging it once downloaded. Either way go ahead and unzip it onto your desktop.

***Be sure to DELETE the RESOURCE GROUP in Microsoft Azure when you are completely done so you don't rack up charges to your subscription!***

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98bb5442-9462-489a-a3c7-024e81b42560)

- Back on the Resource group page in Azure, clcik on your resource group.
- Click Delete resource group.
- Copy and paste the name of your resource group in the text box at the bottom and hit delete.
- Wait and verify the resource group was deleted completely.
- Repeat these steps for the NetworkwatcherRG resource group as well.

<p>
  *Feel free to practice and play around in the osTicketing system to become a pro! 
  You can start by creating an agent who can open tickets by logging into the end user interface, and then create a couple of agents in different departments or teams who can work the tickets. Make sure to set up the SLAs. ChatGPT is a great tool for creating scenarios for you to practice and also to assist you in configuring your helpdesk business if you need it!! I thank you for using this tutorial for you osTicket installation and wish you the best! : )
